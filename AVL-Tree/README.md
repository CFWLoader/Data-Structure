# AVL Tree Algorithm

## The algorithm is based on Binary Search Tree(BST).

## The original C codes of AVL algorithm can't apply in this.

## I modified it.So I guess will trigger severe bugs though

## it haven't occurred in my test.

There are 4 kinds of avl rotation LL, RR, LR, RL.<br/>
I can't figure out difference of them.
