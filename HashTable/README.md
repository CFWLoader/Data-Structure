# Hash table
## Mainly implementing three ways to solve hash conflicts.
## Linear Detection
## Linked List
## Mapping
+ ### The inspire is generated from the thoughts of computer memory cache.
+ ### I am thinking how to implement it.
+ ### This method seems useless.
+ ### But I think it's efficient for big objects.
+ ### Finally, I found out what I'm implementing is the prototype of hash mapping.

### PS: I simply implement the key function. Maybe I will implements more and use template.
