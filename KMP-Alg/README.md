# KMP Algorithm

### I took 2 days to figure out the definition of KMP algorithm and finish the codes.

### (Note) The kmp codes searched in internet is optimized a lot.
### So it's hard to figure out how to implement kmp algorithm.
### I learnt the definition and theory of kmp.My implementation is
### original and unoptimized.

### The time complexity of unoptimized prefix function is O(n^2) while the
### optimized is O(n+m).

### The optimized codes from internet is so hard to understand...
### It forced me to find a lot of theories.

### Until now, I can figure out optimized kmp algorithm codes.
### I speculate that the optimized kmp is based on the fact:
### the next sub string prefix value is current sub string prefix
### value + 1 or 0.

### Waiting for big leg to tell me the truth.
