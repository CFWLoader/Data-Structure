# Fibonacci Heap

Algorithms in F-Heap almost use do-while structure to fix the bidirectional link.<br/>

## Reach Target
-	Construction of Node data structure.
-	Logic of Node operation works correctly.

## Fixed Problem
-	GraphvizOutput class can't generate edges correctly.
-	Memory leaking in FibonacciHeapNode class's detructor.
-	Logic of setting brothers leads fatal error.
-	Setter function can't demand the logic of concatenating two node lists.

## Current Problem
-	Having to add a function of FibonacciHeapNode to fix the link function of FibonacciHeap.
