# Binary tree

## This code seems like just implementing the definition of binary tree.

## In Binary Tree.cpp
* ### point_to_the_root() function seems like meaningless.

## In Binary Tree_adv.cpp
* ### It seems I was trying to encapsulate a c++ version binary tree but failed.

## In Haffuman tree
* ### I confess that I was learning c++ at that time.
* ### Bad encapsulation of object.

## I will try my best to find the codes optimized though I have lost them.
